Super Web Share helps to easily add native share prompt to your website for easy page/post sharing in less than a minute.

== Description ==

Super Web Share is a WordPress based native share plugin that helps users to easily share the page/post with others by prompting the native share action. As SuperWebShare only shows the apps installed within the device upon the share prompt, the rate of sharing of post/page will be higher. Due to that reason website developers can skip the usage of other social media icons upon their website and keep the share more prominent. Super Web Share plugin for WordPress helps to increase your traffic and engagement by a single quick click to share the website with your friends and social medias. Super Web Share works on all supported browsers like Chrome for Android, Edge for Android, Brave for Android and also on Opera for Android. It will show the native apps which are installed upon the device once you share the article with others, due to that users can easily share the page/post with other's super easily in just a click. Upon the native share which prompts up, if the users needs they can also copy the link of the website easily.

It takes less than a minute to setup Super Web Share, and we provide a clean uninstall by removing the entire data entry it creates. We also won't save any settings to your database until you manually save the settings.

Currently, Super Web Share plugin provides a share button before and after the post/page and a floating share button where you can set the color, text of the share buttons, position of the floating button and can also set the pages or posts which you would like to show the share buttons via our Settings page, to easily add the share feature to your websites.
