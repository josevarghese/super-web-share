# Contributing to Super Web Share

Howdy, itâ€™s really great you want to contribute to the Super Web Share! Before you dive in, here are a few pointers on how to contribute.

## Reporting an issue

Super Web Share WordPress plugin should have all issues reported on GitHub at https://github.com/superwebshare/SuperWebShare-WordPress-Plugin/issues.

## Submitting Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix
* If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit tests for your changes
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the WP Rocket repository

## Testing a Pull Request
If you're using Git locally, you can test a pull request by pulling down the associated branch, creating a zip file of the contents, and uploading to your site. This repository includes all compiled files, so it should install just like any other uploaded plugin. 

If you're not already using Git, you may benefit from installing the [GitHub desktop application](https://desktop.github.com). This will allow you to [download the repository in  one click](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/), keep it in sync, and easily [switch between different pull requests](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/accessing-a-pull-request-locally/). Once a pull request is selected in the application, create a zip file of the whole repository, and upload it to your site to test.

## Best Practices
Whatever you add, make sure you follow the plugin review handbook requirements here: https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/performing-reviews/.

### Commit Messages

Here are some good ideas for commit messages:

- Keep them to a one line summary.
- Keep them short (50 chars or less).
- Make them relevant to the commit.

## Commit Process

All changes happen through a pull request made by contributors, ideally associated with an issue. After you send your proposed changes, one of the committers will review and test. After that, we can merge the changes.

When you add a pull request, please also add in the description your WordPress.org username. We will then add it to CONTRIBUTORS.md. This is a running list of all contributors and essential to giving everyone that has helped make this project awesome.
